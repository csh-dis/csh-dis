The [Complexity Science Hub](https://www.csh.ac.at) is the leading European research institute for the study of complex systems. Complexity science links mathematics, computational modelling, and data and network science with fundamental questions from a range of disciplines – medicine, economics, ecology, social sciences – to achieve a deep understanding of systemic risks, resilience, efficiency, and the requirements for sustainable innovation and creativity.

The Digital Innovation School provides advanced education and training opportunities for students, postdocs, and practitioners who are interested in using science to change the world. We train researchers to develop and apply large-scale computational and data-driven approaches to real-world problems and thereby aid complex decision-making, and support practitioners in the use of such practices to aid in the construction, implementation, and adoption of effective policies and practices. We are committed to fostering deep collaboration between academic researchers and governments, corporations, and other impact-oriented organizations.
